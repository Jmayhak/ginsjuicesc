                <p>I've always had an appreciation for healthy living, specifically the way the body appreciates and
                    rewards you for
                    getting what it needs. I began juicing in my cute little cottage kitchen for my husband and me. I
                    immediately
                    became fascinated with the art of juicing. How can you cram, stuff, and twist fruit and veggies into
                    a hole on
                    one end of the juicer, and then on the other end a smooth river of vibrant color comes rushing out?
                    On top of
                    that, this river of color is what your body needs and wants and it's full of nutrients. Is it too
                    good to be
                    true? No, and realizing that, I fell in love!</p>

                <p>I soon began bringing Mason jars full of juice to my co-workers
                    and became the New Age Milk Lady with my glass bottle returns. Soon I was upgrading to a new juicer,
                    buying more
                    juicing books, and becoming bolder with my combinations. Then I signed up for as many local farmers’
                    markets as
                    I could and voilà… this is where we are now!</p>

                <p> I'm thrilled to share my juice with the people of
                    Columbia who are
                    passionate, though not perfect, about what they put in their bodies. Thank you for being a part of
                    our juicing
                    story, and we can’t wait to make a juice just for you!</p>
